# Airbnb-clone
Airbnb-clone is my very first front-end project I built using React. So far, I've learnt and made use of concepts like react components and props to build this site. I also learnt how to make my code composable. 

To run this project locally:
Step 1:
        Download the folder 
Step 2:
        Using the terminal cd into the folder
Step 3:
        Run "npm install"  (without quotes)
Step 4:
        Run "npm run dev"  (without quotes)
Step 5:
        Go to your browser and paste the localhost url
